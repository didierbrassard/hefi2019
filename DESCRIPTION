Description: This function scores dietary constituents provided in the input dataset according to the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019 scoring algorithm (Brassard et al., Appl Physiol Nutr Metab 2022; PMID: 35030038. http://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2021-0415). The original variables are kept in the output data. New variables include density of intakes (i.e., ratios of dietary constituents), HEFI-2019 component scores and the total HEFI-2019 score.
